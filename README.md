TorBox does not control any BitTorrent peers or files, and users are responsible for ensuring they have the legal rights to download the content accessed through our servers. This service is designed to facilitate the download of publicly available and freely distributed materials, such as Linux distributions, independent artists' content, or other non-commercial software.

<h2 id="best-effort">Best-Effort Service</h2>

<p>TorBox is a freemium service offering torrent downloading to its users. TorBox is developed by a small team that does its best to maintain the reliability and uptime of the service. We cannot in good faith guarantee a service level, uptime guarantee, or any other promise of its level of service. Paying for and using the service is subscribing to a fun collective of effort to provide you the best services we can. No refunds are given due to poor service performance, or downtime.</p>

<br/>

<h2 id="dont-sue">Don't Sue TorBox Please</h2>

<p>The service is provided as-is, with no warranty, express or implied. TorBox is under no legal obligation to provide you with service, or keep the service it provides consistent or even available. Even if the service is down for days at a time, we are not legally obligated to reward you in any way, although we always do. Please don't sue us over stuff we don't have an obligation to provide, we don't have the money for all that. If you have a problem with the service, come talk to us first, and we will figure it out.</p>

<br/>

<h2 id="vulnerabilities">Vulnerabilities</h2>

<p>Security and privacy is core to our values at TorBox. If you find a vital security bypass, whether it is our database, download servers, storage servers, or any other service that TorBox runs, please report it to us. Obviously don't make it public, for our sake. You can read more about our bug bountry program <a href="https://support.torbox.app/en/articles/9954012-torbox-bug-bounty-program">here</a>.</p>

<br/>

<h2 id="privacy">Privacy</h2>

<p>TorBox has a robust plain-language privacy policy that details what information is collected and how it is used, and who uses it. By registering for TorBox, you are giving your consent to your data being collected as detailed there. To view it, please go to <a href="https://torbox.app/privacy" target="_blank">https://torbox.app/privacy</a></p>

<br/>

<h2 id="feature-removal">Removal of Features</h2>

<p>TorBox has no obligation to keep new or previous features available to users or any user on our service. We may remove or discontinue features as we decide without notification. No refunds will be given if a feature you paid for is removed during your paid use of TorBox.</p>

<br/>

<h2 id="fair-usage">Fair Usage and Abuse</h2>

<p>TorBox is a shared service. That means there are thousands of people other than you who are using TorBox, likely even at the same time. It is your responsibility you aren't negatively affecting any other user of TorBox. You must ensure your resource consumption (such as bandwidth, storage, or even API requests) are within acceptable limits.</p>

<p>You can read more about our abuse system, and how to avoid warnings and bans <a href="https://support.torbox.app/en/articles/10336778-the-torbox-abuse-system">here</a>.</p>

<p>TorBox reserves the right to stop any downloads, or transfers that are negatively affecting the service. TorBox also reserves the right to remove any files or content from our servers at any time without notification. Your account will be warned and banned if you do not abide by these terms.. Do not use TorBox in an unfair or malicious manner. Please allow everyone to have a great experience using TorBox.</p>

<br/>

<h2 id="refunds">Refunds</h2>

<p>TorBox does not offer refunds. This is due to the type of service TorBox offers as once you use it once, you have already "used" the service. We don't allow refunds for users who have more than 1 download since their purchase. This is to ensure we are fairly paid for you using our service. Even if you purchase a month long subscription and only use it for a day, if you have more than one download then we do not allow refunds or even partial refunds. Any disputes made will lead to an instant ban from the service as well as an IP ban meaning you will no longer be able to create a new account or log into an existing one. We are a completely freeium service which means you have a ton of time to try out and test the service before hand. If you don't like the service, then don't pay for it! We are a small company and cannot afford to hand out refunds for users who have already used the service.</p>

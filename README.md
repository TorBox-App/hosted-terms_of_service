<h2 id="purpose">Purpose and description of service</h2>

<p>TorBox as a service, allows you to download torrents over the BitTorrent peer to peer network onto our servers, and download/stream/use the completed torrents from our storage. This means that you as a user has control over what content or files you download. This service was created for anyone including yourself to download public and freely available content over the BitTorrent network. This means that you must have the legal right to download and use the content or files you download to and from our servers. As such, no copyrighted data is allowed to be stored and accessed from our servers.</p>

<br/>

<h2 id="dmca">Copyrighted content and DMCA</h2>

<p>While we prohibit downloading copyrighted content, we cannot monitor or track downloads of users (check our Privacy Policy), which means that actively seeking out and banning users is impossible. TorBox's distribution of content provided by its users does not express or implies approval of material by TorBox, nor does it confirm that the material is in compliance with the Terms of Service.</p>

<p>We only take action when a valid DMCA request is forwarded to us by our server providers. Let's talk about that for a second. TorBox is an entity of South Africa. Our download servers (where we download torrents to) are hosted in the Netherlands, which means that a valid DMCA, needs to be from an entity of the Netherlands. This means that a DMCA from an entity in the USA is not valid, and will be ignored by our provider. Again, any claims from any other countries, including the USA, will be ignored by our providers.</p>

<p>If you believe to have a valid DMCA, please contact one of our providers. If valid, it will be forwarded to TorBox and we will remove the content within 48 hours. If you have an abuse complaint such as knowledge of illicit material being distributed from TorBox, please fill send an email to abuse@torbox.app.</p>

<br/>

<h2 id="best-effort">Best-Effort Service</h2>

<p>TorBox is a freemium service offering torrent downloading to its users. TorBox is developed by a small team that does its best to maintain the reliability and uptime of the service. We cannot in good faith guarantee a service level, uptime guarantee, or any other promise of its level of service. Paying for and using the service is subscribing to a fun collective of effort to provide you the best services we can.</p>

<br/>

<h2 id="dont-sue">Don't sue TorBox please</h2>

<p>The service is provided as-is, with no warranty, express or implied. TorBox is under no legal obligation to provide you with service, or keep the service it provides consistent or even available. Even if the service is down for days at a time, we are not legally obligated to reward you in any way, although we always do :). Please don't sue us over stuff we don't have an obligation to provide, we don't have the money for all that. If you have a problem with the service, come talk to us first, and we will figure it out.</p>

<br/>

<h2 id="termination">How to not get banned from TorBox (Termination of Service)</h2>

<p>TorBox reserves the right to ban your account at any time. Below are some examples of when your account may be banned. We are not limited to just these examples either, there can be a lot of ways to get yourself banned (but it usually never happens). There are no refunds for paid accounts who have been banned.</p>

<p>Well, the first possible way is trying to make duplicate accounts. TorBox automatically bans any duplicate accounts using the same email as another previous user. This means that the <i>"+"</i> or <i>"."</i> tricks won't work for having multiple emails. We also ban accounts trying to use known spam domains as well so don't even try that.</p>

<p>Don't try and scam us. Any charge backs, carding, or other abusive payment tricks will get your account instantly banned.</p>

<p>Don't allow public access to your downloads. Posting the download link on a forum will get you banned. If we notice a huge increase in downloads for a specific file coming from somewhere, we will ban whoever requested that link. Links are all "pre-signed", and linked to your account, so we can figure out who shared it. Sharing with friends and family is completely fine. Multiple people can even download the same file at the same time. Our system will only send us an alert around the 10-15 mark. Because download links are generated, they are only available for around an hour (which means you only get an hour to start the download, you will still be able to continue downloading even after the link expires, but if you pause or cancel the download, you will have to request the download link again.), 10-15 for us seemed like a safe number.</p>

<p>TorBox has a great and open API. Please don't break it for everyone. Most requests have an API key attached, so we know who it comes from. While we actually don't log our API or any requests, we will if we get reports of a slow API or downtime due to abuse. We have rate-limiting in place so this really shouldn't be an issue, but we simply ask for you to keep limits in place on your side too.</p>

<p>Selling accounts is a no-no too. Just don't, we have lots of payment methods, and will even take other forms of payment if you contact us.</p>

<br/>

<h2 id="vulnerabilities">Vulnerabilities</h2>

<p>Security and privacy is core to our values at TorBox. If you find a vital security bypass, whether it is our database, download servers, storage servers, or any other service that TorBox runs, please report it to us. Obviously don't make it public, for our sake. You will be handsomely reported you intelligent person you.</p>

<br/>

<h2 id="privacy">Privacy</h2>

<p>TorBox has a robust plain-language privacy policy that details what information is collected and how it is used, and who uses it. By registering for TorBox, you are giving your consent to your data being collected as detailed there. To view it, please go to <a href="https://torbox.app/privacy" target="_blank">https://torbox.app/privacy</a></p>

<br/>

<h2 id="fair-usage">Fair Usage</h2>

<p>TorBox is a shared service. That means there are thousands of people other than you who are using TorBox, likely even at the same time. It is your responsibility you aren't negatively affecting any other user of TorBox. You must ensure your resource consumption (such as bandwidth, storage, or even API requests) are within acceptable limits.</p>

<p>An example of this would be downloading 10, 500gb torrents all at the same time. Sure, you could do this, but c'mon, couldn't you space them out a little more? Are you actually going to use all of those at the same time? Are you just hoarding? What's the big deal dude?</p>

<p>TorBox reserves the right to stop any downloads, or transfers that are negatively affecting the service. Your account will be banned if abuse happens often (or just more than once) and there will be no refunds. Do not use TorBox in an unfair or malicious manner. Please allow everyone to have a great experience using TorBox.</p>

<br/>

<h2 id="Refunds">Refunds</h2>

<p>Generally TorBox does not allow refunds. This is due to the type of service TorBox offers as once you use it once, you have already "used" the service. We don't allow refunds for users who have more than 1 download since their purchase. This is to ensure we are fairly paid for you using our service. Even if you purchase a month long subscription and only use it for a day, if you have more than one download then we do not allow refunds or even partial refunds. Any disputes made will lead to an instant ban from the service as well as an IP ban meaning you will no longer be able to create a new account or log into an existing one. We are a completely freeium service which means you have a ton of time to try out and test the service before hand. If you don't like the service, then don't pay for it! We are a small company and cannot afford to hand out refunds for users who have already used the service. There are some cases where we do offer refunds. One being if the service was not working for an extended period of your subscription. The other being if you are upgrading and want to be prorated for your previous time. We will only offer refunds in those 2 cases.</p>
